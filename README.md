# Job Search Tracker

_Link to deployed site_: <https://job-search-tracker-9e5f8.uc.r.appspot.com/>

As my wife and I completed our road trip around the US, we wanted to be able to track our job searches. Erin started brainstorming features, planning to just use a spreadsheet, and like a dummy, I said, "that sounds like a web app," and now I have to build the app.

## Technical Details

The Job Search Tracker is built using Node.js, Pug, and Firebase Cloud Firestore. It's deployed to Google App Engine's flexible environment.

More details:

- Node.js: I've used it many times before and wanted something nice and familiar.
- Pug: I've never actually used Pug before, but have had many people tell me it's great, so I wanted to try it out.
- Bootstrap: because design is hard
- Cloud Firestore: I've only used Firebase with Android projects in the past, and was interested to see how it would integrate with a traditional web app.
- AppEngine: Again, I hadn't deployed a site this way previously, but wanted to try it out.
